## What is G&R?
G&R is a mobile app solution for everyone: farmers, merchants or the common population. Its purpose is to serve as a tool that enables the match between food and someone who is in need of it, whether for their own consumption, for animal feed or for fertilizers. With this, we were able to reduce food waste and consequently the emission of carbon dioxide. Using state-of-the-art technology to classify food through images and to identify potential interested parties in the food, we will be able to reduce waste. In a single application, the user can donate and order food and, whenever they want, can see their waste and sustainability statistics.
